 In developing the app, I focused on ensuring a visually cohesive and professional design across all pages, using various shades of blue to evoke a sense of calm. I chose minimalist styles for buttons and forms, enhancing usability with subtle design elements like shadow effects and rounded corners. Balancing aesthetics with functionality posed a challenge, particularly in aligning design elements across different pages. Through iterative design and testing, I learned the importance of detail in UI design and the value of maintaining a consistent theme while adapting to usability needs.

In redesigning the ContactPage for my portfolio app, I aimed to enhance user interaction while maintaining a visually appealing interface. I implemented an image picker feature that allows users to easily upload images from their devices, making their interactions more personalized. 

 I encountered several challenges, particularly in ensuring that images selected by users were displayed correctly and promptly. Adapting the app for consistent functionality across both iOS and Android platforms required detailed adjustments, especially in managing access permissions with Expo's Image Picker. I focused on balancing these functional changes with a streamlined design, which involved special layout planning and iterative testing. This approach was crucial to refining the appâ€™s functionality and improving the overall user experience, ensuring the interface remained simple and effective for all users.
