 App dev class

 In developing the app, I focused on ensuring a visually cohesive and professional design across all pages, using various shades of blue to evoke a sense of calm. I chose minimalist styles for buttons and forms, enhancing usability with subtle design elements like shadow effects and rounded corners. Balancing aesthetics with functionality posed a challenge, particularly in aligning design elements across different pages. Through iterative design and testing, I learned the importance of detail in UI design and the value of maintaining a consistent theme while adapting to usability needs.
